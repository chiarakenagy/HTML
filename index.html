  <h1>All About Rufus!</h1>

  <h3>Where it all started...</h3>

  <p> After our first family dog, Porter, died, our other dog Chaka was left all alone. </p>
  <img src = "IMG_3157.JPG" alt="Chaka, Isabelle, and Chiara" width = "250" height= "210"/>

  <p> So, we decided to make an addition. Rufus was born on December 4, 2012. When we brought him home, Rufus and Chaka became fast friends, and our family immediately adored Rufus.</p>

  <p> Rufus grew up before our eyes! He was a sweet and playful puppy, and made all types of messes while still putting a smile on our faces. </p>
